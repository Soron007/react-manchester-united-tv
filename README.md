# react-manchester-united-tv

# My passion lies in football and alas! I could not ever play in professionally. So, it gave me immense pleasure in developing this project.

# This is Manchester United TV, a home for only Manchester United videos of various categories

# Tech used: ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, Youtube API. I used React's context API for state management. Deployed the app in Netlify.

# I tailored the requests using the Youtube API so on clicking any category, the relevant Manchester United video displays

# Demo: https://svk-mutv.netlify.app/
